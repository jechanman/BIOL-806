My name is Jett Chan, and I'm a second year undergrad Biology major at UNH. I lived my entire life before college in Massachusetts, and before I came to UNH, I did two years of computer engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology (I didn't like it that much, so I transferred here.)
   
   
Here is an actual picture of me (and my mom).
